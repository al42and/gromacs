Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The deform option caused parallel mdrun to exit
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With the deform mdp option mdrun would exit with an MPI error
when invoked with more than one MPI rank.

:issue:`4604`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With flexible constraint grompp and mdrun exited with an assertion failure
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`4605`

Corrected gmx awh friction metric legend
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The output of friction metric with :ref:`gmx awh` -more is the sqrt of
the metric while ``sqrt`` was missing from the legend. This has been
added now. Note that the output of :ref:`gmx awh` -fric, correctly,
does not involve sqrt.

:issue:`4598`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed argument checking with nvcc
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Incorrect configure-time checks of flags passed to nvcc resulted in
several performance-related flags never being used. Simulations using
Nvidia GPUs were correct but may not have achieved best possible
performance.
